This repository contains the following things I use:
* Linux configuration files: mainly in .config/ and there is also the .vimrc
* LaTeX files:
    * Snippets in .config/vim/UltiSnips/tex.snippets
    * Other files in .latex_resources/
* Small scripts: Located in .config/bin/


### Installation
To install the Linux configuration files:
1. Download the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font,
2. Download this repository,
3. In your home folder, move the files you downloaded to their corresponding spots,
    * For example, place the .vimrc in your home folder, and the i3 folder in your .config/ folder,
4. To make the small scripts executable as a terminal command, add ~/.config/bin/ to your $PATH by following [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/), for example,
